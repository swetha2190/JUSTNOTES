1) javascript 3 chapters
2) LINQ to sql classes
3) read from xml
4) write to xml

-----------------------

1. html -used for static web pages

2.for dynamic pages we need scripting 

3.scripting is of two types based on where they run
a) client side scripting
b) server side scripting

primitive types in js
numbers
string
boolean

Q) create label textbox ,and one add button and display addition of two numbers.

syntax to read:: var value = document.<feild_name>.<form_name>.value
or
document.getelementbyid("id").value

var name=document.id.value
or
var name =document.feildname.value

Q)create

redirect to homepage
else

invalid username and password

task
xml
xsd

read from xml and write into xml
linq to sql classes
=================
what is js
y js
how to reffer an js file into html
why js called loosely typed
what r defferent things can be achieved using js

alternate way for regEXP 

document.form.text.match(p)

what is markup lan?
1- made of tags
2-child tag is nested inside parent tag
3-only one root element
4-every opening tag has a closing tag

===== xml =========
send and recieve data across
diff hardware and diff software
diff languages 
diff technologies
diff devices
---> any format (extensible)
---> xml is a plain text file
---> extensible markup language (xml)
---> used to describe and define data 
---> and to exchange data across dissimilar environments
---> elements are building blocks of xml
---> they describe and define data
--->xml has evolved from SGML

q) create employee details

wellformed xml
==============

should have PI
one root element
In one root element all elements should be nested inside
every opening tag should have closing tag

attribute :: additional information in an element is an attribute
attribute  values should be in double quotes
to display > &gt; <lt; &quote;

xml parse checks for all the conditions

if you want to search and it is unique go for attribute

#xml doesnot check for order/sequence of elements & datatype of data


----> for strict check on order/sequence of elements DTD

--->strict check on order/sequence of elements datatype of data

xml schema definition .xsd
===================================JQUERY=================

--> jquery is a javascript library
--> its lightweight
--> it can b added to any technology
--> add html tag at runtime
--> handle events and validation
--> huge collection of widges
--> three libraries 1)jqueryUI 2)JQUERYvalidation 3)jquery
diff things we can achieve
-->read and wite ,animation effects,validate,

start with $ document.ready is optional

============LINQ TO SQL CLASSES===============

-->c# console application --solution explorer--project name--right click--add---new--item-data--linq to sql classes

-->complete the wizard

-->========================ASP.NET=========================

-->web technology used for web applications 

-->asp.net evolved from ASP which is active server pages

-->STEPS for creating first program in visual studio(2017 version)

-->new--project--web--asp.net web application(.net framework)--select solution if you work with many related project

--select empty/webforms (webforms gives readymade code)  --webforms(checkbox tick)--

-->view--solution explorer--right click --add--webform/webpage --give extension home.aspx--u get a code now

-->every class in your asp.net inherits class 'SYSTEM.WEB.UI.PAGE'

-->EVERY CLASS IS A PARTIAL CLASS IN ENTIRE ASP.NET
